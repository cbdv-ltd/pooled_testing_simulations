# pooled_testing_simulations
simulations for evaluating increase in test capacity/decrease in cost for pool sizes, potential failure rates and limits of detection.

Matrix_bootstrap.py is the relevant script.
The others use simulated distributions that are extremely sensitive to the actual parameterisation of the fit. Use at your own risk.
